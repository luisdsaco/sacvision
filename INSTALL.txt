INSTALLING DIRECTY FROM ANACONDA REPOSITORIES
---------------------------------------------

Its possible to get both versions of the package directly from anaconda repositories.

Conda users:

	conda install -c luisdsaco sacvision
	
Pip users:

	pip install -i https://pypi.anaconda.org/luisdsaco/simple sacvision

This should be the preferred option.

You must enter to execute the program:

	sacvision

INSTALLING FROM SOURCE CODE AT GITHUB REPOSITORY
------------------------------------------------

This program requires the following libraries and python bindings:

- Opencv
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- PyQt

The program has been developed and tested with the following versions:

- python 3.10.2
- opencv 4.5.5
- numpy 1.22.2
- matplotlib 3.5.1
- pyqt 5.12.3
- qt 5.12.9

Anaconda users can do this with the following comands:

	conda install opencv
	conda install numpy
	conda install matplotlib

This will install all their dependencies.

If you want to preserve your python environment you can create previously a new environment
with:

	conda create --name sacvision python=3.10
	
This can be done with anaconda navigator too if you prefer to use a GUI. The proper libraries
can be found at conda-forge. You will need to select the channel before the installation
commands:

	conda config --add channels conda-forge
	
The package can be built and install with the following commands
	
	conda build recipe
	conda install --use-local sacvision

Without anaconda, the packages can be installed from the system or with pip.

Pip users can build and install the package with:

	pip install

from sacvision main directory.

Ubuntu users can introduce the following command:

	sudo apt install python3-opencv python3-numpy python3-matplolib python3-pyqt5

if they prefer the system libraries instead of building the python packages from pip in order to install the python bindings and the required libraries. Currently the package is configured
to be built with python 3.10 that is not supported by ubuntu yet.

It is possible that minimal modifications in the code can be needed depending on the OS
version. Last Ubuntu includes previous versions of the libraries. We do not guarantee the
program works with other libraries than previously indicated. That is the reason why anaconda
with conda-forge is recommended.

The version 0.0.1 is a development one. Changes can be introduced later.
