This program requires the following libraries and python bindings:

- Opencv
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- PyQt

The program has been developed and tested with the following versions:

- python 3.10.2
- opencv 4.5.5
- numpy 1.22.2
- matplotlib 3.5.1
- pyqt 5.12.3
- qt 5.12.9

For anaconda users you can do this with the following comands:

	conda install opencv
	conda install numpy
	conda install pyqt
	conda install matplotlib

If you want to preserve your python environment you can create previously a new environment
with:

	conda create --name sacvision python=3.10
	
This can be done with anaconda navigator too if you prefer to use a GUI. The proper libraries
can be found at conda-forge. You will need to select the channel before the installation
commands:

	conda config --add channels conda-forge

Without anaconda, you must install the packages from the system or with pip.

For instance, in ubuntu you will need to introduce the following command:

	sudo apt install python3-opencv python3-numpy python3-matplolib python3-pyqt5

in order to install the python bindings.

It is possible that minimal modifications in the code can be needed depending on the OS
version. Last Ubuntu includes previous versions of the libraries. We do not guarantee the
program works with other libraries than previously indicated. That is the reason why anaconda
with conda-forge is recommended.

The version 0.0.1 is a development one. Changes can be introduced later.
