This program requires the following libraries and python bindings:

- Opencv
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- PyQt

The program has been developed and tested with the following versions:

- python 3.10.2
- opencv 4.5.5
- numpy 1.22.2
- matplotlib 3.5.1
- pyqt 5.12.3
- qt 5.12.9

For anaconda users you can do this with the following comands:

	conda install opencv
	conda install numpy
	conda install pyqt
	conda install matplotlib

If you want to preserve your python environment you can create previously a new environment
with:

	conda create --name sacvision python=3.10
	
This can be done with anaconda navigator too if you prefer to use a GUI. The proper libraries
can be found at conda-forge. You will need to select the channel before the installation
commands:

	conda config --add channels conda-forge

Without anaconda, you must install the packages from the system or with pip.

The version 0.0.1 is a development one. Changes can be introduced later.
